**IMPORTANT:** This is not better than Ninjabrain bot, nor does it pretend to contend with it. I made this because I wanted a calculator that used math I could realistically do quickly even without the bot. This calculator is not offcially approved by speedrun.com, and is primarily intended for my own personal use.

## ✨ Features

## 📋 How to Use
1. **Throw your first Eye of Ender**.  
2. Line up your camera **exactly with the eye** and press `F3 + C`  
   *(Perfect measurement is not required, but will greatly increase accuracy.)*  
3. Turn 90° from the direction of the first eye and run about 3 chunks, and repeat steps 1 & 2.
   *(With perfect throws you don't need to go as far. With non-perfect throws going farther will increase accuracy.)* 
5. After the second throw, the calculator will instantly display:
   - 📍 **Coordinates of the stronghold**
   - 📏 **Distance from your current location**  
6. To restart the process, press **Shift + Backspace**.
